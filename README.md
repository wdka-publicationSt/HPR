# Hybrid Publication's Resources

This repository consists of a collection of resources aimed at the development hybrid publications, in both reflowable format (EPUB3) and *fixed layout* (Scribus and inDesign structured content).

The resources propose a workflow based on the conversion between markup languages, using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) (the convert) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (source-file) as its essential elements.

Most of the ideas materialized in this collections of resources originated from the research developed by the [Digital Publishing Toolkit](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/) research project, and most specially the controbutions from [Michael Murtaugh](http://automatist.org) and [Silvio Lorusso](http://silviolorusso.com/).
